# Tic-Tac-Toe

## A Trip Down Memory Lane...
  As a child, tic-tac-toe was a game that you could play anywhere or on anything! During long road trips in the car, on a fast food napkin... Or on the chalkboard at school, when the teacher leaves the room. Tic-tac-toe is a classic game for all ages and can become a go to game during spells of boredom.

  What a simple game! To the naked eye (or non-software developer), tic-tac-toe seems simple and easy. Just draw a grid, and fill them with "X's" or "O's".

  During the build out of this project, I found that tic-tac-toe has never been so complicated! Through some hard work, research, and logic tic-tac-toe is now available to you anywhere at anytime. No need for writing utensils anymore!

  I chose to do a Caribbean beach theme as I was inspired by my desire for warmer weather as winter nears, and my brother and I used to play tic-tac-toe in the sand growing up!

### Project Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
  - DRY Javascript
  - localStorage to persist data
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how data is applied to the DOM
- Iterate through/filter through DOM elements using loops
- Using problem solving skills to break down large problems
  - Using logic to independently solve tic-tac-toe game logic

### Project Expectations
_This project is an important step in demonstrating you are ready to start Module 2. To ensure we can accurately assess that, it‚Äôs important you meet the expectations:_

- You are the only one who should type code - no copy-pasting code!
- For any code that you didn‚Äôt write entirely by yourself (mentor or rock supported), you should be able delete it and re-write it yourself
- The only resources you use are MDN, CSS Tricks, and lesson plans - no youtube videos or tutorials of programming Tic Tac Toe. If you have an opportunity and are tempted, do the right thing for YOUR learning and don‚Äôt do it!
- Any peer-to-peer collaboration should be discussions about IDEAS, not coding together or sharing code.

### Technologies Used
- `Javascript` _for DOM manipulation, and game functionality_
- `HTML` _basic structure of app_
- `CSS` _styling_
- `JSON` _accessing localStorage_
- `Local Storage` _storing user data_
- `git/Github & Github Projects` _workflow and project management_
- `Atom` _text editor_

### Code Architecture
#### HTML
I built a basic HTML structure for this project, my goal was to make everything simple and clean... Just like the game of tic-tac-toe. I made sure to use minimal amounts of divs, keep my classes organized, and only use id's when necessary for Javascript.
#### CSS
In my CSS you will see that I organized all stylings by section. I applied some general stylings to `HTML` & `Body`, from there I broke each section out by area: `Player-Sidebars` & `Game-Area` (each area is labeled appropriately for better readability). Attempting to keep my CSS "DRY"... I styled elements by classes or tags only, and reduced repetitive styling.
#### Javascript
Breaking out my Javascript code into three files, helped with keeping the game functionality and DOM manipulation entirely separate.

1) `player.js`: _contains code regarding to the player class:_
  - Created a `Player` class
      - `constructor` _containing one parameter of `playerId`_
          - Properties:
            - `id`: _assigns unique ID to each player_
            - `token`: _stores the value of players game piece_
            - `wins` : _number of wins of player_  
          - Methods:
            - `saveWins`: _saves `Player` wins to localStorage by ID_
            - `retrieveWins`: _updates `Player` wins from localStorage_
            - `resetWins`: _resets `Players` wins to `0` in local localStorage_
2) `game.js`: _contains code for game functionality and game logic_
  - Created a `Game` class
    - `constructor` _containing two parameter of `playerOne` & `playerTwo_
        - Properties:
          - `turn`: _default of playerOne_
          - `turnCount`: _default of `0`, keeping track of move counts_
          - `possibleMoveValues`: _set to available moves, default being all `9` potential move opportunities_
          - `playerOne` & `playerTwo`: _default as empty array, storing player move values_
          - `win` & `draw`: _defaulted to false, changes on game result_
          - `winner`: _identifies a winner_
          - `winCombinations`: _stores logic of every possible winning move combinations, set by each square in a tic-tac-toe board as a value of `1-9`_
        - Methods:
          - `selectPlayersTurn`:_determines which player turn it is, based of the `turnCount`_
          - `recordPlayersTurn`: _takes a players move and stores into specific player's move array, and removes that move from  `possibleMoveValues`_
          - `evaluateWin`: _iterates through win combinations by comparing the players moves array by index of win combinations. As there are 3 indexes in a win combination, each condition statement is set to an index of 0-2. If a value is returned great than or equal to 0, the players moves match with an index from the win combinations. If all 3 match, it is a win!_
          - `evaluteDraw`: _a little more simple, if all possible moves have been played, and there is no win. It is a draw!_
          - `checkBoardForWinOrDraw`: _identifying that a win cannot happen before `5` moves, there is no need to check for a win before then. At `5` moves, this method checks for wins and draws simultaneously_
          - `resetBoard`: _simply resets default values_
3) `main.js`: _DOM manipulation_
  - Global Variables:
    - `querySelectors`
    - instance of `Game` class
    - 2 instances of `Player` class
  - Event Listeners
  - Functions and Event Handlers
    - `connectBoardToGame`: _this sets up the user's board to main functionality from `game.js` and is called on page `load`_
    - `resetWinCount` & `toggleResetWinsButton`: _provides user's with an extra feature. The user can now reset their wins, this allows for new users to play on the same app!_
    - `clickGrid`: _makes grid clickable, and records users move by connecting the `id` of each child element to the possible moves_
    - `disableGrid`: _disables clickable feature when a win or draw is detected_
    - `identifyGameResults`: _checks for wins/draws and displays results to users_
    - `checkGameForResults`: _identifies if there was a win or draw, and displays message to user based on outcome, after that there is a timeOut that resets the board_
    - `displayWins`: _updates users view of wins, based on the record kept in local localStorage_

### Challenges: _Oh boy, where to start...._
- **Game Logic**
  - Taking the time to figure out the game logic, was definitely a puzzle. It was something I enjoyed doing, but took a fair amount of time to apply to that logic to code.
- **Learning to test my code and data model, without DOM**
  - The basic concept of this is something that I was getting the hang of prior to starting this project but applying ways to test my code was proven to be a little more difficult this time around.
  - Hard coding for instant results on code functionality helped, but presented a little more struggle once moving into DOM manipulation.
- **Comparing player moves to win combinations**
  - This was my largest struggle, I spent a lot of time trying to make this method work in the `game.js` file. I found myself researching and pseudocoding 10 different ideas of how I could make this work. I started to mix up and confuse each idea or strategy, causing the time spent on this merthod to take up a lot more time than I had hoped for.
  - When using MDN for prototype array methods, I was more focused on finding an answer and moving on. I didn't fully ready or test out the article I was looking at before trying to code with it. For example, I have used `.indexOf()` a fair amount of times before.. but not to its full potential. Having read the MDN information on it in full before trying to make it work would have led me to a working method much, much sooner.

### Wins & Reflections!
- **Completion and additional functionality**
  - At the beginning of this project, I had severe imposter syndrome going on. Being able to work through those thoughts and feeling and provide an end product I am proud of is HUGE for me.
- **Time & Task Management**
  - I used gitHub projects every step of the way. Usually, I build one out but forget to reference it throughout my project. Taking the time to actually keep it updated proved to be super helpful!
  - Setting daily goals helped me organize my time and thoughts, and kept me on track and where I want to be.
- **Planning & PsuedoCoding**
  - This was the first time I really spent a good amount of time planning. It made a huge difference in my thought process and my productivity.

### Functionality

#### App Layout
_The first task was to build out and match the provided comp, with my own styling preferences_

#### Playing the Game
_The tic-tac-toe board starts empty, and the message displays which users turn it currently is. As the users take turns selecting a space to place their `üçπ` or `ü¶©` the spaces are filled and disabled on the user's click and their correct game token. After a user has taken their turn, the message will change based on which user's turn it is._

_Notice there is a button added... This button is currently disabled, while players are in the middle of their game_

#### Declaring a Win or Draw
_After a win occurs the message declaring which users turn it is, is changed to declaring a user win!_

![WIN!](./assets/functionality-snap-shots/snap3-win.png)

_When a win is declared, the user's win count increases and the game resets. The win count for each user remains on the screen after each game and a page refresh. Notice: The reset button has changed colors and is now clickable!_

![more WINS!](./assets/functionality-snap-shots/snap4-more-wins.png)

#### Continuing To Play
_If a user a new user joins on the same browser, the user has the option of resetting the win counts to even the score! Notice: üçπ's wins have reset to `0` but ü¶©'s have not!_
